# Apollo-Plots

A digital recreation of plots from NASA SP-287 : "What made Apollo a success?"

I love the look of these plots, so I am recreating them, with Python and Matplotlib for now.

I have changed the font to ISOCPEUR, to give it an "engineering drawing" look.

This is work in progress. I'm eye-balling the data points in some graphs.
